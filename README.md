- 👋 Hi, I’m Anna @rennerak
- 👀 I’m interested in computational biology research with a focus on immunology and respiratory diseases, and enthusiastic about chocolate, drawing and coding. 
- 🌱 I have completed a master's in molecular medicine with practical research experience in wet and dry lab. My journey through bioinformatic analyses during my master's thesis sparked a high passion for bioinformatics. Currently I am following that passion by complementing my master's with advanced courses from the master's program in Applied Bioinformatics. Now, as a research assistant in High Performance Computing, I'm fueling that passion by sharpening my coding skills whilst readying myself to embark on the new exciting journey: hopefully starting a PhD. 
- 💬 Always happy to chat about research and coding. Please feel free to reach out!
