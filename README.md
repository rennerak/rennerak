- 👋 Hi, I’m Anna @rennerak
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics, infectiology & immunology research, and enthusiastic about chocolate, drawing and coding. 
- 🌱 I have completed a masters in molecular medicine with practical research experience in wet and dry lab. My journey through bioinformatic analysis during my master's thesis sparked a high passion for bioinformatics. Now, as a research associate, I'm fueling that passion by sharpening my coding skills.
- 💬 Always happy to chat about research and coding. Please feel free to reach out!
