- 👋 Hi, I’m Anna @rennerak
- 👀 I’m interested in computational biology research with a focus on immunology and respiratory diseases and enthusiastic about chocolate, drawing, and coding. 
- 🌱 I have completed a master's in molecular medicine with practical research experience in wet and dry lab. My journey through bioinformatic analyses during my master's thesis sparked a high passion for bioinformatics. This led me to pursue a research associate position in industry, where I had the chance to analyze patient data on a big data scale. Currently, I am nurturing that passion by complementing my molecular medicine master's with advanced courses from the master's program in Applied Bioinformatics. In parallel, I am working as a research assistant in High Performance Computing, where I am sharpening my coding skills. 
- 💬 Always happy to chat about research and coding. Please feel free to reach out!
