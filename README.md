- 👋 Hi, I’m Anna @rennerak
- 👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics, infectiology & immunology research, and enthusiastic about chocolate, drawing and coding. 
- 🌱 I have completed a masters in molecular medicine with practical research experience in wet and dry lab supporting development of a deep learning model for quantifying pathogen growth in an innovative organ-on-chip model. This ignited my passion for bioinformatics, and I'm now enhancing my coding skills alongside my role as a research associate.
